// A method to verify that an authorization token is included as a header, and
// that the token is 1) valid, and 2) not expired. (jsonwebtoken checks for
// expired tokens automatically.)
// 
// A "valid" token is one where the payload+our_secret, when hashed with the
// correct hashing algorithm (specified in the JWT header), produces the same
// "signature" (cryptographic hash) as the one in the token. 
// 
// Remember that it is not possible for someone to create and store in the token
// the same hash that jsonwebtoken() will create when verifying the token,
// unless they use the same "secret", because jsonwebtoken() is going to use our
// secret to create a hash to compare to the signature in the JWT (because we
// are going to give it our secret.) If the signature in the JWT was created
// with some other secret key, or without one, the signature in the JWT will not
// match the one that is created by jsonwebtoken().

    // client will include the "type" directive (typically "Bearer") in
    // addition to the token. So we need to strip off the type directive. If we
    // didn't do that, then when it is included (like it almost always is),
    // verification will fail, because we will be trying to verify "Bearer
    // {token}" instead of just "{token}".
